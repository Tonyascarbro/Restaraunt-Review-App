# Restaurant Review Mobile Application Project
---
#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

In  the **Restaurant Reviews** project, it is required to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, it is required to take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Additionally, one will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users. The key topics addressed are as follows:
1. Aria accessibility
2. Service workers
3. Caches
4. API Keys
5. Asynchronous Data
6. Responsive Design via css
7. ES6, Javascript, Json, CSS, html


### How to Run

This code has added Windows Python files. This allows the program to launched on a local server host from the Windows Command file. For Windows: open the command terminal and cd to your project file. Once the project file is reached, type server in the command line. Open a browser and type: localhost:8000. For Mac: In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
